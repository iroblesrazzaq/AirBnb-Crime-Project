# UC Open Data transportation data project
Goals:
- Make heatmap of Hyde Park Lyft Pickup and Dropoff spots
- Integrate shuttle routes into map
- Potentially integrate other transportation data onto map, such as divvy, etc


combined.csv is a csv of the pickup and dropoff csvs merged, so all rides start and end in the given area. use this for analysis.

Todo:
- Look at area of old data, expand area if old area not big enough
- heatmap
- shuttle route integration
- website
- add divvy data? not sure how useful this is -- maybe just divvy stations
- add CTA bus routes
- look into other modes of transportation
